Hello there,

We have encrypted your files using a high-end cryptographic algorithm.
 You will need to pay to get your files back.
 The price depends on the target, ranging from 0.02 BTC to 20 BTC.
 (Dont insist on decryption for 0.02 BTC after reading this; we decide the price on a case-by-case basis.)


There will be no free decryption in the future, so dont waste your money on recovery companies they wont work.
 If they did, I wouldnt waste my time.


So, dont be shy! Contact us, and lets make an agreement.
 We have no reason to keep your files after payment, as that could harm us as well.


Additionally, we may have taken files from your server that hold important data.
 There may be an additional fee to ensure these are not published on the internet.
